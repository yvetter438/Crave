## 🔧 Technical Implementation:

### File Structure:
```
app/
  ├── (tabs)/
  │   └── search.tsx         → Search page (updated)
  └── user/
      └── [id].tsx           → Dynamic user profile
```

### Dynamic Route:
**URL Pattern:** `/user/{user_id}`

Example: `/user/cdc73b26-3030-42aa-9745-3e9254add7bf`

### Navigation Code:
```typescript
// From search page
const handleUserPress = (userId: string) => {
  router.push(`/user/${userId}`);
};
```

### Follow/Unfollow Logic:

**Check if following:**
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('is_following', {
    p_follower_id: currentUserId,
    p_following_id: targetUserId
  });
```

**Follow user:**
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('followers')
  .insert({
    follower_id: currentUserId,
    following_id: targetUserId
  });
```

**Unfollow user:**
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('followers')
  .delete()
  .eq('follower_id', currentUserId)
  .eq('following_id', targetUserId);
```

### Real-time Count Updates:
When you follow/unfollow, the follower count updates instantly on the UI:
```typescript
// After follow
setProfile({
  ...profile,
  followers_count: (profile.followers_count || 0) + 1
});

// After unfollow
setProfile({
  ...profile,
  followers_count: (profile.followers_count || 0) - 1
});
```

## 🎨 Design Details:

### Follow Button States:

**Not Following:**
- Background: Blue `#0095f6`
- Text: White "Follow"
- Bold text

**Following:**
- Background: White
- Border: 1px gray `#dbdbdb`
- Text: Black "Following"
- Bold text

### Profile Stats:
- Font size: 18px (numbers), 14px (labels)
- Bold numbers, gray labels
- Evenly spaced across width

### Posts Grid:
- 3 columns, equal width
- Aspect ratio: 2:3 (vertical)
- 2px margin between posts
- Rounded corners (4px)

## 🔐 Security Features:

**RLS Protection:**
- Users can only follow/unfollow for themselves
- Can't manipulate other users' follows
- Read access to all profiles (public info)

**Authentication Check:**
- Only authenticated users can follow
- Checks current user ID before actions
- Graceful handling if not logged in

## 📊 Database Triggers:

The follower counts update **automatically** via database triggers:

**When someone follows you:**
```sql
-- Your followers_count increases by 1
-- Their following_count increases by 1
```

**When someone unfollows you:**
```sql
-- Your followers_count decreases by 1
-- Their following_count decreases by 1
```

This happens at the database level, so counts stay accurate across all devices!
