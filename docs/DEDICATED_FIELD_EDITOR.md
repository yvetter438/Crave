# Dedicated Field Editor - Instagram Style ✨

## What Changed

We've upgraded the settings page to use **dedicated full-screen editors** for each text field - just like Instagram!

### Before:
- ❌ Inline text inputs that could be pushed around by keyboard
- ❌ All fields visible at once (cluttered)
- ❌ Keyboard covering content

### After:
- ✅ Tap any field → Opens dedicated full-screen editor
- ✅ Field stays at the top, never covered by keyboard
- ✅ Clean, focused editing experience
- ✅ "Done" button in top right to save
- ✅ Chevron (>) indicators showing fields are tappable

## How It Works

### Settings Page (Main Screen)
Each field now displays as a **tappable row** with:
- **Label** on the left (e.g., "Username")
- **Current value** in the middle (or placeholder if empty)
- **Chevron icon (>)** on the right

**Tap any row** → Opens the dedicated editor for that field

### Dedicated Editor Screen
When you tap a field, a full-screen modal opens with:
- **Header:**
  - X icon (left) - Cancel and discard changes
  - Field name (center) - e.g., "Bio"
  - Done button (right) - Save changes
- **Text Input:**
  - Auto-focused and keyboard appears immediately
  - Stays at the top of the screen
  - Shows character count (e.g., "45/500")
  - Multiline for Bio field, single line for others

### Fields Configuration

| Field | Max Length | Multiline | Auto-Capitalize |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Username | 30 chars | No | None (lowercase) |
| Name | 50 chars | No | Words |
| Bio | 500 chars | Yes | Sentences |
| Location | 100 chars | No | Words |
| Instagram | 30 chars | No | None |

## User Experience Benefits

1. **No Keyboard Blocking** - Field stays visible at top of screen
2. **Focused Editing** - One field at a time, less distraction
3. **Better for Long Text** - Bio editing is much easier with full screen
4. **Mobile-First Design** - Feels native to iOS/Android
5. **Clear Save/Cancel** - Done to save, X to cancel
6. **Visual Feedback** - Chevron shows fields are interactive

## Technical Implementation

### New Component: `TextFieldEditor.tsx`
Location: `/components/TextFieldEditor.tsx`

**Features:**
- Full-screen modal with slide animation
- Auto-focuses input on open
- Handles keyboard avoiding automatically
- Character counter
- Supports single-line and multiline
- Customizable capitalization

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  visible: boolean;           // Show/hide modal
  title: string;             // Header title
  value: string;             // Current field value
  placeholder?: string;      // Placeholder text
  maxLength?: number;        // Character limit
  multiline?: boolean;       // Allow multiple lines
  autoCapitalize?: string;   // Capitalization mode
  onSave: (value) => void;   // Save callback
  onClose: () => void;       // Close callback
}
```

### Updated: `settings.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed inline TextInput components
- Added TouchableOpacity for each field
- Added `openFieldEditor()` function
- Added `handleFieldSave()` function
- Added `editorVisible` and `currentField` state
- Updated styles for tappable field rows

## Design Details

### Field Row Styles:
- Height: 56px min
- Padding: 18px vertical
- Label: 100px width, semi-bold
- Value: Fills remaining space
- Chevron: 20px, light gray
- Divider: 0.5px line below each field

### Colors:
- Label: Black `#000`
- Value: Black `#000`
- Placeholder: Gray `#999`
- Chevron: Light gray `#c7c7c7`
- Divider: Gray `#dbdbdb`

## Example Flow

1. User opens Settings page
2. Sees "Bio" field with current text or placeholder
3. Taps the Bio row
4. Full-screen editor slides up
5. Keyboard appears, input is focused
6. User types their bio
7. Character count updates: "45/500"
8. User taps "Done" in top right
9. Editor closes, Settings page shows new bio
10. "Done" button appears in Settings header (because changes were made)
11. User taps "Done" to save all changes to database

## Testing

Try these scenarios:
- [ ] Tap Username field → Editor opens
- [ ] Type "testuser" → Character count shows
- [ ] Tap Done → Returns to settings with new value
- [ ] Tap X (cancel) → Discards changes
- [ ] Edit Bio with long text → Multiline works
- [ ] Try to type 501 characters in Bio → Stops at 500
- [ ] Edit Instagram → Automatically removes @ if typed
- [ ] All fields show chevron (>) on right
- [ ] Keyboard never covers the input field

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- Validation messages in the editor
- Real-time username availability check
- Emoji picker for bio
- Suggested locations dropdown
- Instagram handle verification
- Preview mode before saving
