# Apple App Store UGC Compliance Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive User-Generated Content (UGC) moderation features implemented to meet Apple App Store guidelines and ensure a safe, respectful community on Crave.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Comment Profanity Filtering
**Location:** `utils/profanityFilter.ts`

**What it does:**
- Filters offensive language before comments are posted
- Checks for common profanity, slurs, and hate speech
- Validates comment length and content
- Detects spam patterns (excessive URLs, repetition)

**How it works:**
- When a user tries to post a comment, the text is validated
- If profanity or spam is detected, an alert is shown and the comment is blocked
- Users receive clear feedback about why their comment was rejected

**User Experience:**
```
User types: "This is f*cking amazing!"
System: Shows alert "Cannot Post Comment - Your comment contains inappropriate language..."
```

### 2. Reporting System

#### For Comments
**Location:** `components/Comment.tsx`, `components/ReportModal.tsx`

**What it does:**
- Users can report offensive comments
- Comments can be reported for: spam, harassment, hate speech, violence, sexual content, misinformation, copyright, or other reasons
- Reports are confidential - the reported user won't know who reported them

**How to use:**
1. Tap the "..." (ellipsis) button on any comment (that's not your own)
2. Choose "Report Comment"
3. Select a reason and optionally provide additional details
4. Submit the report

#### For Videos/Posts
**Location:** `components/VideoPost.tsx`, `components/ReportModal.tsx`

**What it does:**
- Users can report offensive or inappropriate videos
- Same reporting categories as comments
- Integrates with existing moderation system

**How to use:**
1. Tap the "..." button on the video overlay
2. Choose "Report Post"
3. Select a reason and provide details
4. Submit the report

### 3. User Blocking System

#### Block from Comments
**Location:** `components/Comment.tsx`, `components/BlockUserModal.tsx`

**What it does:**
- Users can block abusive commenters
- Blocked users' comments are immediately hidden
- The blocked user won't be notified

**How to use:**
1. Tap the "..." button on a comment
2. Choose "Block User"
3. Confirm the block
4. All comments from that user disappear immediately

#### Block from Videos
**Location:** `components/VideoPost.tsx`, `components/BlockUserModal.tsx`

**What it does:**
- Users can block content creators
- Blocked users' videos won't appear in your feed
- The blocked user won't be notified

**How to use:**
1. Tap the "..." button on a video
2. Choose "Block User"
3. Confirm the block
4. Navigate back to feed (blocked user's content is filtered out)

### 4. Content Filtering

#### Blocked Users' Content is Hidden
**What gets filtered:**
- ‚úÖ Videos/posts from blocked users don't appear in feed
- ‚úÖ Comments from blocked users are hidden
- ‚úÖ Replies from blocked users are hidden
- ‚úÖ Feed automatically updates when blocking/unblocking

**Database Functions:**
- `get_ranked_feed_with_moderation` - Filters posts
- `get_comments_with_moderation` - Filters comments
- `get_comment_replies_with_moderation` - Filters replies

### 5. Moderation Status Integration

**Status Types:**

**For Posts:**
- `pending` - Awaiting moderator review (not shown in feed)
- `approved` - Reviewed and approved (shown in feed)
- `removed` - Removed by moderators (not shown anywhere)

**For Comments:**
- `visible` - Normal, visible comment
- `removed` - Removed by moderators (not shown)

**Feed Behavior:**
- Only `approved` posts appear in feeds
- Only `visible` comments appear on posts
- Removed content is never shown to users

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Tables

#### `user_blocks`
```sql
- id (bigserial, primary key)
- blocker_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- blocked_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- UNIQUE(blocker_id, blocked_id)
- CHECK(blocker_id != blocked_id) -- Can't block yourself
```

#### `reports`
```sql
- id (bigserial, primary key)
- reporter_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- target_type (text: 'post', 'comment', 'user')
- target_id (bigint)
- reason (text: 'spam', 'harassment', 'hate_speech', etc.)
- description (text, optional)
- status (text: 'pending', 'reviewed', 'resolved', 'dismissed')
- reviewed_by (uuid, references auth.users)
- reviewed_at (timestamptz)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- UNIQUE(reporter_id, target_type, target_id) -- One report per user per item
```

#### Posts & Comments Status Columns
```sql
-- Posts
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN status text DEFAULT 'pending';
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN removed_at timestamptz;
ALTER TABLE posts ADD COLUMN removed_reason text;

-- Comments
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN status text DEFAULT 'visible';
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN removed_at timestamptz;
ALTER TABLE comments ADD COLUMN removed_reason text;
```

### Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### User Blocks
- ‚úÖ Users can view their own blocks
- ‚úÖ Users can create blocks (block others)
- ‚úÖ Users can delete blocks (unblock)
- ‚ùå Users cannot view others' block lists

#### Reports
- ‚úÖ Users can view their own submitted reports
- ‚úÖ Users can create new reports
- ‚úÖ Moderators can view all reports
- ‚úÖ Moderators can update report status
- ‚ùå Users cannot view reports submitted by others

### Database Functions

#### `get_comments_with_moderation(p_post_id, p_user_id)`
Returns comments for a post with moderation filters:
- Filters out comments from blocked users
- Only returns `visible` comments
- Includes like counts and user metadata

#### `get_comment_replies_with_moderation(p_parent_comment_id, p_user_id)`
Returns replies to a comment with moderation filters:
- Filters out replies from blocked users
- Only returns `visible` replies

#### `get_ranked_feed_with_moderation(p_user_id, p_limit, p_offset, p_seed)`
Returns feed posts with moderation filters:
- Only returns `approved` posts
- Filters out posts from blocked users
- Applies engagement-based ranking

#### `is_user_blocked(blocker_id_param, blocked_id_param)`
Helper function to check if one user has blocked another.

#### `get_blocked_users(p_user_id)`
Returns list of users that the specified user has blocked.
Useful for managing blocks in settings.

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created
```sql
-- Blocking queries
idx_user_blocks_blocker_blocked (blocker_id, blocked_id)
idx_user_blocks_blocked (blocked_id)

-- Content status filtering
idx_comments_status_visible (status) WHERE status = 'visible'
idx_posts_status_approved (status) WHERE status = 'approved'

-- Report management
idx_reports_status_pending (status) WHERE status = 'pending'
idx_reports_target_composite (target_type, target_id, status)
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Run SQL Migration
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor
# Run the file: supabase_enhanced_ugc_moderation.sql
```

This migration will:
- Create new database functions with moderation filters
- Set up RLS policies for user_blocks and reports
- Add performance indexes
- Create helper functions

### 2. Verify Migration
```sql
-- Check functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%moderation%';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('user_blocks', 'reports');

-- Check indexes
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('user_blocks', 'comments', 'posts', 'reports');
```

### Profanity filter not working
- Verify import: `import { validateCommentText } from '@/utils/profanityFilter'`
- Check that CommentSheet.tsx has the validation code
- Test in development with console.logs

### Blocks not persisting
- Check user_blocks table has data: `SELECT * FROM user_blocks WHERE blocker_id = 'your-user-id'`
- Verify RLS policies allow inserts

### Feed still showing blocked users
- Verify feed uses `get_ranked_feed_with_moderation` function
- Check that feed query includes user ID parameter
- Confirm blocked user exists in user_blocks table
