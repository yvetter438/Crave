# Business Validation Metrics Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Data for Your Entrepreneurial Hypothesis**

You're absolutely right - you need **hard data** to validate if your business hypothesis is legit. Here's what you're now tracking:

## ðŸ“Š **Essential Business Validation Metrics**

### **1. User Retention (Proves Product-Market Fit)**
- **Daily App Opens** - Are users coming back?
- **Session Duration** - Are they actually using it?
- **Engagement Depth** - Are they interacting with content?
- **Retention Cohorts** - Do they stick around over time?

### **2. Content Engagement (Proves Value Proposition)**
- **Video Likes/Comments** - Is content engaging?
- **Upload Success Rate** - Are users creating content?
- **Time Spent Watching** - Is content valuable?
- **Share Rate** - Is content shareable?

### **3. User Behavior (Proves Product Stickiness)**
- **Actions Per Session** - How engaged are they?
- **Session Frequency** - How often do they return?
- **Feature Usage** - Which features matter?
- **Drop-off Points** - Where do users leave?

## ðŸ”¥ **Smart Tracking (No Credit Burning)**

### **Daily App Opens Tracking:**
```typescript
// Tracks opens per day without spamming
{
  "event": "app_opened",
  "properties": {
    "is_first_open_today": true,
    "daily_opens_count": 3,
    "session_id": "session_123"
  }
}
```

### **Engagement Score Calculation:**
```typescript
// Combines duration + actions for engagement score
engagementScore = actionsPerformed + (sessionDurationSeconds / 30)
// High: >10, Medium: 5-10, Low: <5
```

### **Session Quality Tracking:**
```typescript
// Only tracks meaningful sessions (>10 seconds or actions)
{
  "event": "engagement_session",
  "properties": {
    "duration_seconds": 120,
    "actions_performed": 8,
    "engagement_score": 12,
    "engagement_level": "high"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Key Metrics to Validate Your Hypothesis**

### **1. User Acquisition Validation:**
- **Signup Rate** - Are people interested?
- **Onboarding Completion** - Is the product clear?
- **First Upload Success** - Is it easy to use?

### **2. Engagement Validation:**
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)** - Are people using it daily?
- **Session Duration** - Are they spending time?
- **Actions Per Session** - Are they interacting?
- **Return Rate** - Do they come back?

### **3. Content Validation:**
- **Upload Success Rate** - Is content creation working?
- **Like/Comment Rate** - Is content engaging?
- **Share Rate** - Is content shareable?
- **Watch Time** - Is content valuable?

### **4. Retention Validation:**
- **Day 1 Retention** - Do they come back next day?
- **Day 7 Retention** - Do they stick around?
- **Day 30 Retention** - Are they long-term users?

## ðŸŽ¯ **Business Hypothesis Validation Framework**

### **Hypothesis: "People want to share food videos and discover new restaurants"**

#### **Validation Metrics:**
1. **Content Creation** - Upload success rate > 80%
2. **Engagement** - Average session > 2 minutes
3. **Retention** - Day 7 retention > 30%
4. **Social Proof** - Like/comment rate > 5%

#### **Red Flags (Hypothesis Failing):**
- Upload success rate < 50%
- Average session < 30 seconds
- Day 1 retention < 20%
- Like rate < 1%

## ðŸ“Š **PostHog Dashboard Setup**

### **1. User Acquisition Funnel:**
```
App Opened â†’ Sign Up â†’ Onboarding â†’ First Upload â†’ First Like
```

### **2. Engagement Dashboard:**
- **DAU/MAU Ratio** - Daily vs Monthly Active Users
- **Session Duration Distribution** - How long users stay
- **Actions Per Session** - Engagement depth
- **Engagement Score Distribution** - High/Medium/Low users

### **3. Retention Analysis:**
- **Cohort Analysis** - Users by signup date
- **Retention Curves** - Day 1, 7, 30 retention
- **Churn Analysis** - When users stop using

### **4. Content Performance:**
- **Upload Success Rate** - Technical success
- **Content Engagement** - Likes, comments, shares
- **Watch Time** - Content value
- **Viral Coefficient** - Shares per view

## ðŸš€ **Actionable Insights**

### **If Metrics Look Good:**
- **Double down** on successful features

- **Optimize** the user experience
- **Prepare** for growth

### **If Metrics Look Bad:**
- **Identify** specific problems

- **Learn** from failures

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips for Business Validation**

### **3. Track Cohort Performance:**
- **Compare** different user segments
- **Identify** what makes users successful
- **Optimize** for your best users
