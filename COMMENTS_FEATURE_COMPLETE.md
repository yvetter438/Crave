# Comments Feature Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
A fully functional commenting system has been implemented for video posts, featuring Instagram/TikTok-style UI and threaded replies.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅
- **comments table**: Stores all comments with support for threaded replies
- **comment_likes table**: Tracks who liked which comments
- **posts.comments_count**: Denormalized counter for performance
- **Auto-updating triggers**: Keeps comment counts accurate
- **RLS Policies**: Secure access control for all tables
- **Helper Functions**: 
  - `get_comments_with_metadata()` - Fetches comments with user info, likes, and replies
  - `get_comment_replies()` - Fetches threaded replies for a comment

### 2. UI Components ✅

#### CommentSheet.tsx
- Bottom sheet modal that slides up from bottom (Instagram/TikTok style)
- Smooth spring animation
- Shows comment count in header
- Lists all top-level comments
- Text input with send button
- Reply indicator when replying to comments
- Keyboard-aware scrolling
- Empty state with icon and message
- Auto-refreshes comment count on close

#### Comment.tsx
- Displays user avatar (or default icon)
- Shows displayname (or username fallback)
- Shows comment text
- "Time ago" formatting (e.g., "2h", "3d")
- Like button with count
- Reply button
- View/Hide replies toggle (for threaded comments)
- Optimistic UI updates for likes

#### CommentReplies.tsx
- Fetches and displays threaded replies
- Indented layout with visual separator
- Instagram-style flat threading (not nested like Reddit)
- Replying to a reply creates a reply to the parent comment

### 3. VideoPost Integration ✅
- Comment button added to sidebar (between Like and Save buttons)
- Shows comment count badge
- Opens CommentSheet on tap
- Haptic feedback
- Auto-refreshes count after commenting

## File Structure

```
/components/
  ├── CommentSheet.tsx       # Main bottom sheet modal
  ├── Comment.tsx           # Individual comment component
  ├── CommentReplies.tsx    # Threaded replies handler
  └── VideoPost.tsx         # Updated with comment button

/supabase_comments_migration.sql  # Database setup
```

## Database Migration

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Located in: supabase_comments_migration.sql
```

This will create:
- `comments` table
- `comment_likes` table  
- `comments_count` column in posts
- Triggers for auto-updating counts
- RLS policies for security
- Helper functions for fetching comments

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User taps comment button on video post
2. Bottom sheet slides up with existing comments
3. User can:
   - Read comments and see avatar, username, time ago
   - Like/unlike comments (tap heart icon)
   - Reply to comments (tap "Reply")
   - Post new top-level comments
   - View threaded replies (tap "View X replies")
   - Hide threaded replies (tap "Hide replies")
4. When replying, an indicator shows who they're replying to
5. User can post comment/reply with send button
6. Comment count updates automatically

### Threading Model
- **Instagram-style**: Flat, not nested
- Parent comment shows "View X replies" button
- Replies are indented and shown under parent
- Replying to a reply still replies to the parent (keeps it flat)
- This keeps the UI clean and easy to follow

### Performance Optimizations
- Comment counts stored in `posts.comments_count` (denormalized)
- Triggers automatically update counts
- Only top-level comments counted (not replies)
- Optimistic UI updates for likes (instant feedback)
- Efficient SQL functions fetch all needed data in one call
