---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Migration

1. Open your **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Run `supabase_ugc_moderation_migration.sql` (creates tables, columns, functions)
3. Run `supabase_ugc_rls_policies.sql` (sets up security policies)

### Step 2: Storage Setup

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Storage**
2. Create a bucket named `videos` (private, not public)
3. Follow instructions in `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` to set up policies

### Step 3: Add Your First Moderator

In Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Replace with your user ID
INSERT INTO moderators (user_id, granted_by)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID_HERE', 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE');
```

To find your user ID:
```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Step 4: Test the Upload Flow

1. Open the app
2. Navigate to the **Upload** tab (new tab with + icon)
3. Select a video
4. Fill in description and optional fields
5. Upload
6. Video will be pending moderation (visible on your profile only)

### Step 5: Moderate Content

**Option A: SQL Queries (Recommended)**
- Use queries from `MODERATION_TOOLS.md`
- View pending posts, approve/remove them

**Option B: Future Admin Dashboard**
- Could build a dedicated admin panel later
- For now, SQL queries are sufficient

### Step 6: Link Terms & Guidelines

Add links to these pages in your settings/profile:
- `router.push('/terms')` - Terms of Service
- `router.push('/guidelines')` - Community Guidelines

- Authors: Can view own comments
- Moderators: Can view all comments

**Reports:**
- Users: Can view own reports

**User Blocks:**
- Users: Can view, insert, delete own blocks

### Feed Algorithm

The new `get_ranked_feed_with_moderation` function:
1. Filters to `status='approved'` posts only
2. Excludes posts from blocked users
3. Excludes recently seen posts (existing logic)
4. Applies engagement-based ranking
5. Returns paginated results

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Why Pending Status?
Apple requires pre-moderation of UGC content. By default, all uploads are `pending` until a moderator reviews and approves them.

### Why Private Storage?
Videos are stored in a private bucket so only the author can view them until the post is approved. This prevents sharing links to unapproved content.

### Why RLS?
Row Level Security ensures that even if someone tries to access the database directly, they can only see/modify content they're authorized for.

### Why Block Instead of Just Mute?
Blocking is bidirectional - the blocked user also can't see your content, providing stronger privacy protection.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Videos Not Uploading
1. Check file size < 100MB
2. Check duration < 3 minutes
3. Verify storage bucket exists and is named `videos`
4. Check storage policies are set up correctly

### Posts Not Appearing in Feed
1. Verify post status is `approved` (not `pending`)
2. Check that user isn't blocked
3. Verify feed function `get_ranked_feed_with_moderation` exists
4. Check RLS policies on `posts` table

### Can't Report Content
1. Verify `reports` table exists
2. Check RLS policies on `reports` table
3. Ensure not trying to report same content twice
4. Check that current user is authenticated

### Moderation Queries Not Working
1. Verify you're added to `moderators` table
2. Check `is_active = true` in moderators table
3. Verify `is_moderator()` function exists
